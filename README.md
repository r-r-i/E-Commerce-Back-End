# Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

## Task

For this challenge, I was given the task of buildin the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. I've configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Mock up

The following video shows the application being used from the command line, and its results within Insomnia.

## Installation Instructions

To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:

``` 
npm i
```

## Usage Information

This application is purely made on the back end, and does not have any front-end visual tied to it.
